## Description

Craft is a Minecraft Clone, originally developed by @fogleman on Github with several different contributors.
See [fogleman/Craft on Github](https://github.com/fogleman/Craft) for the original project from source.

Craft has been abandoned by the original team so this is a revival of the earlier project.
The main goal of this project at this time is to make it moddable, using [Python](https://www.python.org/), or [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).
